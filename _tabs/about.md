I'm currently a student at the University of Louisville double majoring in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. I'm passionate about the field of Cyber Security, but more specifically offensive security.

## School

I currently attend the University of Louisville J.B. School of Engineering and currently a senior. I am heavily involved in many activities such as the ACM Cyber Defense Team and working for the Computer Science and Engineering department within the data center to help support the faculty and students with projects and common computer issues. In addition, I was also a graduate teaching assistant for a Computer and Cyber Crime class at the school of Criminal Justice teaching about common cyber security tools, safe practices, cyber security events, and any projects during the semester.

## Self Study

During my free time I like to spend time sharpening my skills through hacking platforms, programming projects, and CTFs. Here are a few platforms that I use to practice and learn different skills in the field of security: Hack-The-Box, PentesterLab, and Pentester Academey. I also have my own home lab where I build upon my knowledge about virtualization, linux, networking, offensive/defensive security, and to play around with other tools and operating systems.
