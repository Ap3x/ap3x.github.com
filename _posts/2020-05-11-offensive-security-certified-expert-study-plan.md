While taking summer computer science and engineering classes I took part in an independent study which allows me to make my own course essentially and do research on the topics I choose. So I decided to build the course around my study plan for obtaining my OSCE certification. Please note that this is a shorten version of the my study plan for the independent study since I will be covering this content in about 2.5 months. More than likely I will continue my studying after the independent study course is over to prepare for the OSCE exam. I used a few different resources to come up with this study plan from resources such as the Pentester Academy x86_64 content and abatchy's OSCE blog study plan and a few others.
